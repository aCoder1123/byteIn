## TODO
* create nice dashboard for the general display. this contains tables, showing what's available and what's not
* admin page
    * same dashboard view -> could click on a table on the map and assign it - this creates a config file that could write to an NFC reader - this needs to automatically set up the raspi pico to read GT buzzcards and act as a node in the system
    * map creator view - an image of the table map can be uploaded. we need to convert this to an interactive map that could be added to the dashboard
